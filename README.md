# A little background information

This code exercise is intended to evaluate your software engineering skills but also give you an introduction into the types of problems we solve at Bold Penguin. Your solution will be evaluated based on the ability to produce intended results, cleanliness, adherence to best practices, maintainability, and readability. You should write code like you would if this were an actual assignment. You do not need to gold plate your solution, but we are looking for something more than a script.  Ideally your solution would demonstrate your understand of object-oriented principles and best practices.

# The Dynamic Form Generatoin Problem

One of the problems Bold Penguin helps solve is matching business owners who are searching for a policy with an agent and carrier can provide and bind a policy.

To this end, Bold Penguin writes software that asks questions about the business to be insured so to determine an agent/carrier match for the particular business/owner.

The goal is to provide a path that provides a user experience short in duration while also providing the most accurate match.  We use question sets that are generated from a set of rules data provided by agents and carriers.

## Getting Started

Clone **this** repo, please don't make a fork of it.

```bash
$ git clone <REPO URL HERE>
```

You'll need to setup your development environment with Javascript and Angular. This step is platform dependent, so you'll need to figure it out yourself.

## Your Assignment

**After completing each of the steps below, commit your changes to your local clone with a meaningful commit message.**

1. Create a new angular project and set up an injectible service that will be responsible for retrieving the question set data from: 
```bash
!!!!<insert endpoint here> & any other info needed to access it successfully
```
2. Install the Angular Material Module 







# DynamicFormGeneration

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
